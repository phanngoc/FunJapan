                    “Site” – which may later be revised or changed for any reason), and strives to expand interest in Japan by introducing Japanese products and services to consumers across Asia.</p>
                  <p>The governing body of Fun! Japan, the Fun! Japan Team, offers services and information to its customers according to the following Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”). "Fun! Japan" hereby refers to the Fun! Japan Project, this Site, the individual

                  <h2>Account</h2>
                  <p>When using this Site, you understand and agree to be held responsible for your account, in safeguarding your password and supervising the use and access to your account. If someone accesses your account or uses your account to access
                    the Site, we will rely on that account ID and will assume that access has been made by you, and you will be held responsible for any conduct made through your account. Please notify us immediately if you suspect or become aware that
                    your account has been used without your authorization. We at Fun! Japan reserve the right to remove any and/or all of your submissions, suspend, and/or terminate your account with or without prior notice. Regardless of whether intentional
                    or negligent infringement, costs, losses and damages arising in connection with termination as a result of password theft, loss, or unauthorized use (such as, but not limited to: investigation costs, preventive measures costs, attorney
                    fees, claim correspondence costs) shall not be charged to Fun! Japan. We reserve the right to revise or delete contents, stop or change promotions or campaigns, deny service, suspend accounts without notice.</p>
                  <h2>Fun! Japan Point</h2>
                  <p>Fun! Japan Point (“FP”) can only be used for the specific uses designated by Fun! Japan, such as to apply for campaigns on the Site and to access articles that are exclusive for members of the Site.</p>
                  <p>FP can be earned by: registering as a member of the Site; logging into the Site; entering a fortune lottery; answering questionnaires; registering as favorite the webpages for which FP is provided; sharing such webpages; commenting on
                    such webpages; participating in campaigns; and other methods designated by Fun! Japan.</p>
                  <p>FP is not available for purchase. Unless otherwise designated, FP is valid for one year from the account holder’s last login date. When an account is terminated, FP earned through such terminated account will become invalid. All FP will
                    become invalid if the Site is closed or if Fun! Japan Project is terminated. FP cannot be transferred to other point programs. FP cannot be exchanged for cash or other kinds of points under any circumstances. FP is granted to specific
                    accounts and can only be used for the specific account and cannot be transferred to other accounts.</p>

                  <p>If there is a change in the registration, including the email address, you are responsible for notifying us of such changes. If a customer fails to provide or update registration matters and is therefore unable to receive services or
                    experience losses, Fun! Japan will not be held responsible for such losses.</p>

                  <p>As a user of Fun! Japan, you may submit comments, photographs, or other contents, or transmit proposals, ideas, comments, questions, or other information, so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive
                    of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights, injurious to third parties, or objectionable, or does not consist of or include software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings
                    or any form of spam. You may not use a false email address, impersonate any person or entity, or act in any way so as to mislead others on the origin of any content. Although Fun! Japan reserves the right (but not the obligation) to
                    delete or edit such contents, it does not periodically confirm submitted contents.</p>
                  <p>Unless the site explicitly states otherwise, when you submit a content or transmit a material, you grant Fun! Japan a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt,

                    content, if they choose. You will not exercise your moral right of an author against Fun! Japan or any of its sublicensees. You represent and warrant to Fun! Japan that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content
                    you post; that the content is accurate; that the use of the content you supply does not violate these Terms of Use and will not cause injury to any third person or entity; and that you will compensate Fun! Japan for all claims arising
                    from the content you supply. Fun! Japan does not guarantee that it will accurately record or save any information or materials submitted or posted by you, and Fun! Japan assumes no liability or responsibility for lost, alteration or
                    leaking of such information or materials. Fun! Japan reserves the right, but not the obligation, to monitor, edit, or delete any act or content. Fun! Japan takes no responsibility or assumes no liability for any content posted by you
                    or any third party.</p>
